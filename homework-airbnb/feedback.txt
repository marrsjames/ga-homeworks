Hi James! Awesome Insta homework - just took a look and it looks really good so nice effort :sunglasses: Again you’ve used flex box really well and all the elements are in the right place so that’s great :100:
Also nice one that you managed to do the mobile version - looks good - maybe just add an align-items: center so that it sits in the centre of the page:
  section:last-of-type {
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 100%;
    padding: 0 10px;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
Apart from that your code looks great and a great finish exericse to the CSS & HTML content . Let me know if you had any specific questions for this one as I don’t have much feedback for your code. Keep up the good work :slightly_smiling_face:

thanks very much, Elsie! i did have one question  actually... is there a way to tidy up and combine the below into just one rule?
9:07
.app > h3 {
  color: black;
}
.log-in > h3 {
  color: black;
}

You could do:
.app > h3, .log-in > h3 {
  color: black;
}
So you just separate the selector by a comma
