Hey James! Awesome effort on the homework - looks wicked so really well done :raised_hands: I love the colour changes for the results
Your code looks great and it’s clear that you’ve understood how to interact with the DOM so i'm happy to see it all working!
In terms of your code - just a few suggestions…
Completely up to you how you separate your code but I tend to separate the variables / elements / functions and then put all the eventListeners at the bottom of the page. Just means that all the different bits are grouped together:
// Elements
// Variables
// Functions
// Event Listeners
Then you could make your code a lil more concise on your result function. I would maybe do something like so:
  function result() {
    const playerResult = playerCurrent.textContent
    const computerResult = computerCurrent.textContent
    if (playerResult === computerResult) {
      console.log('draw')
      gameResult.textContent = "It's a draw!"
      background.classList = ""
      background.classList.add('draw')
    } else if ((computerResult === 'Paper' && playerResult === 'Rock') || (computerResult === 'Rock' && playerResult === 'Scissors') || (computerResult === 'Scissors' && playerResult === 'Paper')){
      console.log('computer wins')
      gameResult.textContent = "The computer wins!"
      background.classList = ""
      background.classList.add('player-lose')
    } else {
      console.log('player wins')
      gameResult.textContent = "The player wins!"
      background.classList = ""
      background.classList.add('player-win')
    }
  }
Basically what I’ve done here is you’ve essentially got three parts to your if / else statements - you’ve got the first bit (if its a tie) - then you’ve got all the conditions that would mean the computer has won (separated by the OR operator - || ) and then you’ve got our last ‘else’ - which is basically all other options (in this case basically anything that is NOT a tie or NOT the computer winning which means the player wins).
This just means you don’t have to write out all the different conditions and helps you cut back on code which is always what we want.
Apart from that  your code is great and its awesome to see you logging your work as you go. Really nice effort !
Let me know if any of that doesn’t make sense or if you would like me to go over anything else! Really cool work :sunglasses:
