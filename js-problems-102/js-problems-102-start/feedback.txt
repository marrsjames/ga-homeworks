Evening James, hope all is well! I'm just messaging to give you some :star:Homework Feedback:star:
Nice job attempting these questions, some of them are really tough and I struggled with them when I had to do them!
For the removeBlank function, you’re definitely on the right track, and it can be done as follows:
function removeBlank(array) {
  return array.filter((value) => {
    return value === 0 || !!value
  })
}
This solution filters through each item in the array, and says if the value is = 0 OR if the value is true (the !! equates to saying ‘not not’) then return it.
Your randomElement function works which is great, so well done there! Generating a random number in this way is fairly common so it's good that you’ve got it nailed down. Here is my completed code:
function randomElement(array) {
  return array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)]
}
Nice job on the second lowest / highest function, this passes the test which is great! Keep an eye out on your indentation, and the only other thing I would note is make sure you have spaces either side of the - in [array.length - 2], here’s the completed and refactored version:
function secondLowestSecondHighest(array) {
  const orderedArray = array.sort((a,b) => {
    return a - b
  })
  return [orderedArray[1], orderedArray[array.length - 2]]
}
The coin function is a tough one, I struggled for ages when I had to do it, so don’t worry about not giving this one a crack! The completed code is as follows:
function coins(price) {
  let pence = price * 100
  const coins = [100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
  const result = []
  coins.forEach((coin) => {
    while (pence - coin >= 0) {
      pence -= coin
      result.push(coin)
    }
  })
  return result
}
The merge function is fairly simple and can be done using concatenation as below:
function mergeUnique(arr1, arr2) {
  return Array.from(new Set(arr1.concat(arr2)))
}
Have a look through these examples to see if you understand how they are working, and be sure to google anything you’re not sure on!
Your fibonacci function works! Great stuff. Be sure to define all variables (const fibArray = []). Here is some completed code:
function fibonacci(n) {
  const fib = [0]
  for (let I = 1; I < n; I++){
    fib.push(fib[I - 2] + fib[I - 1] || 1)
  }
  return fib
}
Overall a great effort here, you’re clearly picking up on what’s being taught which is great to see, keep it up! If you have any questions let me know!
